# Efficient Learning Noise - Data Repo

This contains the data from the IBMQ 14 used to create the charts and analyais in "Efficient learning of quantum noise".

The twirls themselves are generated using what, in in effect, a set of simultaneous RB circuits. Either single Clifford twirls or a combination of single and double Clifford twirls. This is detailed in the paper.

The data is in the data subfolder, the python notebook to read the pickles in the notebook folder.
